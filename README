The Klout API is designed to return influence metrics generated by Klout. This is a wrapper python wrapper for the klouy api. Providing easy access function to all the api calls.

Klout makes the following information available:

What metrics Klout API returns:
1. Klout Score - is the measurement of your overall online influence.
        The scores range from 1-100 with higher scores representing a wider and
        stronger sphere of influence.
2. Network Influence - is the influence level of your engaged
        audience. Capturing the attention of influencers is no easy task, and
        those who are able to do so are typically creating spectacular content.
3. Amplification Probability - is the likelihood that your content will be
        acted upon. The ability to create content that compels others to respond
        and high-velocity content that spreads into networks beyond your own is
        a key component of influence.
4. True Reach -  is the size of your engaged audience. We eliminate inactive and
        spam accounts, and only include accounts that you influence.
5. Influential About - The topics you are most influential about based not on
        what you talk about the most but on the subjects you get the most
        engagement on.
6. Influencer Of/Influenced By: These are the people who you influence and who
        you are influenced by based on social actions.
